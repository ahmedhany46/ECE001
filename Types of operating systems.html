  <li><p style="color:blue;">Simple Batch System:In this type of system, there is no direct interaction between user and the computer.</li></p>
  <li><p style="color:blue;">Multiprogramming Batch System:In this the operating system picks up and begins to execute one of the jobs from memory.</li></p>
  <li><p style="color:blue;">Multiprocessor System:consists of several processors that share a common physical memory.</li></p>
  <li><p style="color:blue;">Desktop System:Earlier, CPUs and PCs lacked the features needed to protect an operating system from user programs. PC operating systems therefore were neither multiuser nor multitasking. However, the goals of these operating systems have changed with time; instead of maximizing CPU and peripheral utilization, the systems opt for maximizing user convenience and responsiveness.</li></p>
 <li><p style="color:blue;">Distributed Operating System:The motivation behind developing distributed operating systems is the availability of powerful and inexpensive microprocessors and advances in communication technology.</li></p>
  <li><p style="color:blue;">Clustered System:Like parallel systems, clustered systems gather together multiple CPUs to accomplish computational work,differ from parallel systems, however, in that they are composed of two or more individual systems coupled together.</li></p>
  <li><p style="color:blue;">Realtime Operating System:operating system known to give maximum time for each of the critical operations that it performs, like OS calls and interrupt handling.</li></p>
  <li><p style="color:blue;">Handheld System:include Personal Digital Assistants(PDAs), such as Palm-Pilots or Cellular Telephones with connectivity to a network such as the Internet. They are usually of limited size due to which most handheld devices have a small amount of memory, include slow processors, and feature small display screens.</li></p>
